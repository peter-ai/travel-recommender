    "The goal here is that for each table in an excel flat file, given an instance in the data which has an associated destination, we want to compare the destination in the data with our master list of destinations and use fuzzy matching to select the most appropriate match. We replace the original destination with the matched destination. Upon completion, each data set will have the same set of destinations listed, making aggregation more accurate and feasible.\n",

    "Fuzzy matching typically uses the Levenshtein distance (aka the edit distance) or Indel distance as a basis. Both compute the number of operations, or edits, required to transform one string into another. The deletion, insertion, or substitution of a character all result in +1 to the Leneshtein distance (all actions are weighted equally). Related, the Indel distance is similar to the Levenshtein distance except it does not permit substitutions. Effectively, any substitution that would have incurred a cost of +1 is replaced by an insertion and deletion with cost +2, or equivalently, a substitution is given a weight of +2. The normalized distance for Levenshtein is computed as $$\\frac{distance}{max(len(string1),\\ len(string2)}$$ whereas the normalized distance for Indel is computed as $$\\frac{distance}{len(string1)\\ +\\ len(string2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity between two strings is $1-distance$. When using a specific ratio in the FuzzyWuzzy package, the function preprocesses the input strings in some way and then computes the scaled Levenshtein similarity. The Token Sort Ratio splits a string into its tokens/words, makes them lowercase and removes punctuations, then sorts the tokens alphabetically and joins them prior to computing the similarity."

This is typical of approaches based on `collaborative filtering`. From there, memory-based or model-based approaches are specifically taken, but in general, the focus of these methods are in recommending items to users based on the user's similarity to other users, inferring that if users are similar they are likely to like items that other similar users liked. \n",

Hybrid systems also exist, which are likely much more robust in practice.\n",

As a result, we take a more simplistic approach similar to content based systems. We use distance and similarity measures to determine what to recommend to a user based on their own past travel experiences. Specifically we use Gower's distance which can handle both categorical and continuous data."
